## Challenges

As this was my second project, I faced a lot of challenges. Collecting data API’s was challenging for me. I do not find any such API related to my project, I create my own API and deploy it on a live server. I get stuck at many points of the responsive features of the website. But I am able to tackle all these problems in one week.

As I still in the learning phase, the journey of building this website was very nice. I realized that I could’ve achieved even more precision in building the website, but time was running out because I take up a challenge to completer this project in a week.

The feeling of completing the project was very satisfying. Hard work pays off. So, in all this is a great and wonderful experience for me.

Thank you !
